Network Analysis and ERGM project
This repository is designed to contain R scripts that were used for analysis within the report Exponential Random Graph Models As a Method For Network Analysis. All code and datasets are open-source thus increasing the reproducibility of the results. Please note that updates may have become available and so the package versions are listed below. More importantly the Tobacco Control dataset is contained within UserNetR and the Star Wars dataset is contained within dplyr. Updates to these datasets could produce effect the results.
